# sdl2-vero4k

Automated building of SDL2 for the OSMC device Vero 4k.  
This is the basis of all of my emulation repos and would not have been possible without the addition of mali-fbdev support by mihailescu2m to SDL2 - THANK YOU

## Manual Installation Instructions (this repo is meant to be sourced by my others)
Run the following:
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/hissingshark/sdl2-vero4k.git
